Adds support for viewing and handling audio medium items.

This module parses audio files and extracts tags and an optional image from the audio file.

.. note::
    mod_audio uses the command-line utilities ``ffmpeg`` and ``ffprobe``.
    For mod_audio to function correctly they must be present in the search path of Zotonic.

Uploading
^^^^^^^^^

The audio module hooks into the media model to intercept any audio file upload.

If an audio file is uploaded then the file is parsed using ``ffprobe`` to fetch:

 * The bitrate
 * Audio duration
 * Tags, like artist, album
 * Album art image, extracted as png using ``ffmpeg``

The optional album art is used as the preview image. This image is visible when the
audio media item is rendered using a ``{% image ... %}`` tag.

Viewing
^^^^^^^

The audio module extends the ``{% media %}`` tag for viewing ``audio/*`` videos.

It uses the template ``_audio_viewer.tpl`` for viewing.

Editing
^^^^^^^

The following properties are extracted from the audio file, and can be edited in the
admin:

 * artist
 * album
 * album_artist
 * composer
 * genre
 * track
 * copyright
 * is_compilation (boolean flag)
 * org_pubdate, this is extracted form the ``creation_time`` tag

If there is no resource title given when creating the audio page then the title
from the tags is used. If that one is empty then the fileâ€™s basename is used.
